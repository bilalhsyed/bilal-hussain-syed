Coming soon!

This folder will contain code that I created and utilized during my Master of Applied Science from University of Toronto. Since my research project worked with human participants, the code will be added once it has been appropriately vetted.

Code (Python/R) to be added:
-Script that loads raw ECG data, calculates physiological arousal indices (heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, etc), and stores data in Excel files.
-Scripts for data analysis specific to conference presentations: International Society of Autism Research (INSAR) 2020, INSAR 2021, Bloorview Research Institute (BRI) Symposium 2020, BRI 2021, etc.
-Script that loads data (ECG, demographic, psychological questionnaires), cleans data, prepares and performs linear regression and structural equation modeling, and reports results.
-Script that loads data (ECG, demographic, psychological questionnaires), cleans data, prepares and performs random forest analysis, and reports results.
